# 5. Motivation
A lot of students, especially university/college students, have frequent problems with study planning. They end up panicking, don’t know where to begin, and finally do not prepare well, which is the main reason for bad performances in tests and examinations.

Some are able to plan their study using available timetable-making applications in the market. However, few of these tools actually know what users need, and most of them are not optimal for learning management. Why isn’t there a tool that can help you keep track of your learning process and plan your study in a productive way?

# 6. Value Proposition
We hope to make a website that helps users, especially students, plan for work and study in general and promotes efficient study methods, namely active recall and spaced repetition.

The science behind active recall and spaced repetition:
* Active recall is the process of actively drawing information from your memory. It is a proven efficient way of moving knowledge from short-term to long-term memory compared to traditional passive revision, namely rereading, highlighting, etc. 
* Spaced repetition entails spacing the revision of the topics at specific intervals over time, which is proven to be beneficial by the 'forgetting curve.' We can take advantage of the forgetting curve by breaking the cycle by reviewing material at spaced intervals. The more we practice and the more spaced this repetition becomes, we will likely encode this information into our long-term memory.

How is active recall and spaced repetition incorporated into ActiveNUS:
* Calendar: our calendar has a built-in schedule recommendation feature based on the logic of spaced repetition and forgetting curve, helping students plan their studies more efficiently. 
* Flashcards:
  * Active recall is highly encouraged by flashcards. Flashcard is an effective and fun strategy for students to test themselves and utilize their cognitive power more actively
  * Spaced repetition: our flashcard module employs an algorithm that automatically renders a sequence of flashcards based on users’ feedback. The time interval between studying each flashcard will be optimized by the spaced repetition method.

# 7. How are we different from state-of-the-art platforms?

## 7.1 Google Calendar: 
The Calendar application of ActiveNUS has a recommendation system based on active recall and spaced repetition. The users will be provided the most effective study schedule.

## 7.2 Quizlet: 
Our flashcard system employs an underlying algorithm to sort items according to users’ familiarity with their contents.

## 7.3 Pomofocus: 
Our Pomodoro module is not a stand-alone count-down timer, but a useful part of a highly interconnected system. Each successful focus cycle is recorded and updated automatically to the Calendar module.

# 11. Overall Design

We aim to make a website that helps users, especially students, plan for work and study in general and promotes efficient study methods, namely active recall and spaced repetition. To achieve this goal, we came up with the overall design for ActiveNUS.

## 11.1 Core Features

**Dashboard:** a comprehensive overview of your work/study progress and daily tasks 

**Calendar:** help you plan and track your studies with built-in active recall and spaced repetition logic.
* Export iCalendar file so that users can sync with other platforms (e.g. Google Calendar)
* User-friendly GUI to add a study session and categorize it based on modules or topics
* Tracking is enhanced by options to evaluate the studying session (how familiar the user is with the topic after revising).

**User account and Social Forum:** which user can create to save their progress and calendar and interact with friends
* Find friends on ActiveNUS
* Write posts in the forum, react and comment on the others’ posts

**Pomodoro timer:**
* A timer that runs for a default period of 25 minutes focus time and 5 minutes break (user has the option to make adjustment). 
* Each successful studying cycle will be recorded into the tracking calendar. Most of the administrative work is automatically done for the users.
* Send a notification at the system level (when the user is navigating outside the website)
* Users will be rewarded for each successful attempt.

**Flashcards systems:** Flashcard is an indispensable component of the active recall studying method
* Create folders of flashcards based on the topic you are studying for. 
* Accessing the flashcards folder for the topic or module directly from the dashboard

## 11.2 User Interface Design
ActiveNUS’s main target users are students and young people. Therefore, we choose a modern design language for the platform. Furthermore, we also promote simplicity in design, helping users get the best experience of learning and working with ActiveNUS.
The UI style guide and prototypes are included below.

# 12. Project Scopes
The project is broken down into 3 parts corresponding to 3 milestones.

## 12.1 Milestone 1: Setting up authentication and administration

1. Set up application components (Authentication, Dashboard, Admin)

2. Frontend Web Routing: Set up URLs for the components of the applications 

'''python
from django.contrib import admin
from django.urls import path, include
from django.conf.urls.static import static
from django.conf import settings

urlpatterns = [
    path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
    path('auth/', include('authentication.urls')),
    path('', include('dashboard.urls')),
    path('accounts/', include('django.contrib.auth.urls')),
]
'''

3. Set up Database using SQLite3. Models and data are stored in db.sqlite3 file.

4. Set up administration: using Django default admin app and creating a superuser.

5. Token Authentication: implement user registration and login. Users will be able to register (email verification required), and upon logging in, are authenticated and assigned a token, their password will be hashed (instead of being stored as plain text directly).

## 12.2 Building the core

6. Dashboard

6.1. Description

When a user is successfully logged in, he/she is taken to a dashboard page, which displays a comprehensive overview of the user's long-term progress and daily to-do list. Users are able to manually add/delete tasks and sort tasks according to their states. 

![Dashboard](img/dashboard.png)

6.2. Consideration

To-do list design consideration: On using to-do list, users might want to keep track of finished items but not delete them immediately. Therefore, we separate the remove button, which is minimally stylized as a trashcan and the finish toggle button.

Additionally, users can also have an option to move finished tasks to the end. This will be very helpful because in real-life usage, the order users add tasks and finish them are not the same. Hence, users can easily see at a glance which are the undone and done tasks separately.
